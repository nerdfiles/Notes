			<p>In particular, pushdown automata have the ability to keep track not only of 
			embedded clauses ("the hunters chase") but to match verbs and nouns separated 
			in a sentence, that is, to match "the prey" to "runs away." The next level of 
			computational capacity involves a more powerful memory in the form of an 
			infinite tape on which symbols can be stored but access only to a small 
			portion of it. This is enough, however, for linear-bounded automata to handle 
			the stored symbols together with their immediate context and master 
			context-sensitive languages.</p>
