# Analytico-praxiological politics

by politics i understand the fundamental problem of supplying answers to 
matters of economic conflicts over resources inasmuch as conflicts are 
described from and through ontological positions and configurations concerning 
who, what, when, where, why and how those answers may satisfactorily address 
needs and wants with the most without giving rise to antagonism. who wants, 
who needs, what is wanted, what is needs, when, why, etc. 

by praxis i understand the grounding of normativity in the recognition of 
ecologies of knowledge which depend on every species' ergnonomic fit 
to their environment such that it informs their practices of sacrifice, 
motility, meaning-making, positionality and prescriptive behaviors after 
description and validation of local experience or possibility of experience.

by analysis i understand that counting is basic to all matters that would 
inform politics and praxis, prior to modeling, and is more critical to 
developing a real positions and configurations to be discovered. analysis 
supplies the basic constitutes to descriptions which may be given to 
theories of time (A, B, C, E series) such that normative weight may 
measured according to those theories as pertains to dissolving conceptual
confuses which would bring about inappropriately manifesting procedures 
of truth which are the business of politics insofar as it resolves conflicts 
over resources

afro-pessimism is the loss of faith in european plans and power, as it would 
be conceived from polanyi's optimism while maintaining that self-determination 
and optimism ought to be exclusively reserved for black people to devise 
theoretical departures which can do no worse than destroy the world that has
been presented which itself excludes the possibility of the realness of culture,
difference and biodiversity. afro-pessimism is the belief in the countryness 
of blackness, which is a kind of temporal paradox that demands a normativity 
of care of its own social skin as indistinguishable from its own sovereignty

non-philosophy is, without devising my own terms here, the science of philosophical 
Decision. what it agrees on as a kinship with afro-pessimism is the wariness of a certain 
set of tools for engaging the realness of culture, those tools supplied by 
philosophy, philosophers and there "architecture of distinctions". non-philosophy in a way, 
in fact, echoes fred moten's "consent not to be a single being" in that the 
idea of Decision must be thought of as never occurring beyond the scope of 
agreement: no one merely decides *for* humanity without at the same time 
being *of* and so a philosopher is always already agreeing with somebody, even 
one whose spectre precedes them. i might even say that excess precedes both 
existence and essence. in a crude gesture, all distinctions are scoffed at 
unless and until given an empirical basis, so as to avoid the transcendental hallucination 
of the real. i would say that afro-pessimism is at least one global expression 
of laruelle's non-philosophy: a globally transcendental discipline, that is not 
automatically a philosophy
